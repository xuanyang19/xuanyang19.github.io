          Finding items with potential to increase sales is of great importance in online market. In this paper, we propose to study this novel and practical problem: rising star prediction. We call these potential items \emph{Rising Star}, which implies their ability to rise from low-turnover items to best-sellers in the future. Rising stars can be used to help with unfair recommendation in e-commerce platform, balance supply and demand to benefit the retailers and allocate marketing resources rationally.
          Although the study of rising star can bring great benefits, it also poses challenges to us. The sales trend of rising star fluctuates sharply in the short-term and exhibits more contingency caused by some external events (e.g., COVID-19 caused increasing purchase of the face mask) than other items, which cannot be solved by existing sales prediction methods.

          To address above challenges, in this paper, we observe that the presence of rising stars is closely correlated with the early diffusion of user interest in social networks, which is validated in the case of Taocode (an intermediary that diffuses user interest in Taobao).
          Thus, we propose a novel framework, RiseNet, to incorporate the user interest diffusion process with the item dynamic features to effectively predict rising stars.
          Specifically, we adopt a coupled mechanism to capture the dynamic interplay between items and user interest, and a special designed GNN based framework to quantify user interest.
          Our experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets provided by Taobao demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

          Our research aims to reconstruct a reliable network from a ﬂawed, undirected, unweighted network, a process referred to <i>network enhancement</i>. More speciﬁcally, the goal of network enhancement is to detect the noisy links that are observed in the network but should not exist in the real world, as well as to predict the missing links that do indeed exist in the real world yet remain unobserved. 
          
          From one perspective, we turns the network enhancement problem into edge sequences generation, and employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to solve it, which takes advantage of downstream task to guide the network denoising process

Supervised models are utilized to detect game bots in observed patterns according to the training data. Meanwhile, unsupervised solutions are employed to detect clustered game bots and help discovering new bots. The game bot detection framework NGUARD has been implemented and deployed in multiple MMORPG productions in the NetEase Game portfolio, achieving remarkable performance improvement and acceleration compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the framework reveals outstanding robustness for game bots in mutated patterns and even in completely new patterns on account of the design of the auto-iteration mechanism ([<a href="works/nguard/nguard.pdf">Tao and Xu et al, KDD'18</a>];[<a href="works/nguard/nguard_plus.pdf">Xu et al, TKDD'20</a>]).</p> -->
        <p>Lockdown is a common policy used to deter the spread of COVID-19. However, it remains an open question how our society comes back to life after a lockdown. Understanding how cities bounce back from lockdown is critical for promoting the global economy and preparing for future pandemics. Here we propose a novel computational method based on electricity data to study the recovery process, and conduct a case study on Hangzhou. With the designed Recovery Index, we find a variety of recovery patterns in main sectors. One of the main reasons for this difference is policy, therefore, we aim to answer the question of how policies can best facilitate the recovery of society.
           We first analyze how policy affects sectors and employ a Change-point Algorithm to provide a non-subjective approach to policy assessment. Furthermore, we design a model that can predict future recovery, allowing policies to adjust accordingly in advance. We design a deep neural network TPG to model recovery trends, which consists of the graph structure learning to perceive influences between sectors. With the model, we conduct simulation experiments and results offer insights to policy-making that the government should prioritize supporting sectors that have greater influence on others and are influential on the whole economy.
