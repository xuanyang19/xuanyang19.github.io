          Network data in real-world tends to be error-prone due to incomplete sampling, imperfect measurements or even malicious attacks. This in turn results in inaccurate results when performing network analysis or modeling on these ﬂawed networks.<br><br>
          
          Our research aims to reconstruct a reliable network from a ﬂawed one, a process referred to network enhancement. More specifically, network enhancement aims to detect the noisy links that are observed in the network but should not exist in the real world, as well as to complement the missing links that do indeed exist in the real world yet remain unobserved.<br><br>
          
          From one perspective, we turns the network enhancement problem into edge sequences generation, and employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to solve it, which takes advantage of downstream task to guide the network denoising process (NetRL, <a href="works/tkde2021_netrl_xu.pdf">Xu et al, TKDE'21</a>). 
          From another perspective, we construct a self-supervised learning framework that identifies missing links and nosiy links simultaneously by leveraging the mutual influence of them (E-Net, <a href="works/enet/tkde2020_robust_xu.pdf">Xu et al, TKDE'20</a>).<br><br>
          
          Furthermore, we study the model robutness against adversarial attacks. Our work shows that even without any information about the target model, one can still perform effective attacks (<a href="works/11209.XuJ.pdf">Xu et al, AAAI'22</a>). To handle the adversarial vulnerability problem, we further propose an unsupervised defense technique to robustify pre-trained deep graph models (<a href="works/11849.XuJ.pdf">Xu et al, AAAI'22</a>).

        <!-- <p>Game bots are automated programs that assist cheating users and enable them to obtain huge superiority, leading to an imbalance in the game ecosystem and the collapse of user interest. Therefore, game bot detection becomes particularly important and urgent. Among many kinds of online games, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs), such as World of Warcraft and AION, provide immersive gaming experience and attract many loyal fans. At the same time, however, game bots in MMORPGs have proliferated in volume and method, evolving with the real-world detection methods and showing strong diversity, leaving MMORPG bot detection efforts extremely difficult. </p>
        <p>To deal with the fast-changing nature of game bots, we here proposed a generalized game bot detection framework for MMORPGs termed NGUARD, denoting NetEase Games’ Guard. NGUARD takes charge of automatically differentiating game bots from humans for MMORPGs. In detail, NGUARD exploits a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised models are utilized to detect game bots in observed patterns according to the training data. Meanwhile, unsupervised solutions are employed to detect clustered game bots and help discovering new bots. The game bot detection framework NGUARD has been implemented and deployed in multiple MMORPG productions in the NetEase Game portfolio, achieving remarkable performance improvement and acceleration compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the framework reveals outstanding robustness for game bots in mutated patterns and even in completely new patterns on account of the design of the auto-iteration mechanism ([<a href="works/nguard/nguard.pdf">Tao and Xu et al, KDD'18</a>];[<a href="works/nguard/nguard_plus.pdf">Xu et al, TKDD'20</a>]).</p> -->
